One is I wanted to get a leg up in the job market, so having a stronger technical background and a masters degree would help, especially down the line in a job. I came straight from my undergrad in econ here, which I did in two years and two quarters, so that leads to reason two why I wanted to do the program. I wanted my fourth year in college here. I wasn't ready to leave. Also reason number 3 is that this program is much more affordable than ucla or similar program out of state, thought it is still expensive tho for half of the classes being the same as undergrad- maybe thats just how the system works."

I just wanted a new experience and I big city could be fun after living in slo for 4 years. In October I took a job with AT&T so I guess I kind of know what I'll be doing which has been nice. I am doing a data analyst role in a two ish year rotational which should be fun and let me explore and learn a lot. I'll be moving to their HQ in Dallas which is quite a shift, but I know quite a few people there and they all enjoy it. I have heard it is a decent company to work for and the work life balance is not bad, which is big for me. "
